Developers

[Saneem](https://github.com/xaneem) and [Ajnas](https://github.com/ajnas).
We felt we were spending too much "productive" time on typing in the username and password and then clicking the login button. Why not automate it ;).

If you think something is missing, feel free to develop. We love pull requests.
