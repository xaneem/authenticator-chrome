NITC Authenticator
==================

A Chrome extension to automatically complete the Campus Networking Centre authentication. The username and password is to be entered just once inside the plugin.

Installation
------------
This extension is available for Chrome and Firefox. Visit the [**downloads page**](http://www.clusterdev.com/nitc-authenticator/) for instructions.

The production version of this Chrome extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nitc-authenticator/hmnfgjeapkdnjifhelmpihnhmpembohm?hl=en).

To install from source, enable Developer mode in Chrome Extensions, and use the Load unpacked extension button.

Developers
----------
[Saneem](https://github.com/xaneem) and [Ajnas](https://github.com/ajnas).
We felt we were spending too much "productive" time on typing in the username and password and then clicking the login button. Why not automate it ;).

If you think something is missing, feel free to develop. We love pull requests.

Check out the NITC Authenticator [Firefox Add-on](https://github.com/ajnas/authenticator-firefox) too!
